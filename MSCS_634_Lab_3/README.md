# MSCS_634_Lab_3 - Wine Dataset Clustering\n\n## Purpose\nThis lab explores clustering using the Wine dataset from scikit-learn. It applies K-Means and K-Medoids (PAM) with k=3 and compares their performance using Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).\n\n## Files\n- `MSCS_634_Lab_3_Wine_Clustering.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing data preparation, clustering, metrics, visualizations, and brief analysis.\n\n## Key Insights\n- The notebook prints Silhouette Score and ARI for both K-Means and K-Medoids; compare these values to see which method produced better separation and which matched true labels more closely.\n- K-Medoids is generally more robust to outliers since medoids are actual data points, while K-Means is faster and works well for roughly spherical clusters.\n\n## Run Instructions\n1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab.\n2. Run all cells. The notebook installs `scikit-learn-extra` (for `KMedoids`) if not present.\n\n## Challenges / Decisions\n- `KMedoids` is provided by `scikit-learn-extra`; the notebook includes a cell to install it.\n- For visualization, PCA (2 components) is used to project standardized features to 2D for scatter plots.\n\n---\nGenerated by Mahesh Gaire for MSCS 634 - Lab 3.
